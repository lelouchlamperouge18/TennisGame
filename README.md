Game Tennis 

Tennis scoring is similar to other games, but it has been cleverly encoded to sound strange to non- tennis fans. Write a C++ program to keep track of the score of a tennis game. 
When two players play each other in tennis, they are playing a tennis match. The overall objective is to win the match. A tennis match is made up of sets, and a set is made up of games. 
This problem will only involve scoring a single game not a match or a set. A tennis game is made up of points. 
A player wins a tennis game by being the first player to win four points but must win by two. There are no tiebreakers in games. The clever
encoding of tennis scores comes at the point level. The following table describes the different names
for tennis points:

Number of Points Won Name of Score
0                        love
1                         15
2                         30
3                         40

Tennis scores are usually separated by a dash with the serverâ€™s score first, and in this problem player 1
will always be serving. Some example scores are 15-30 and 40-love. When the score is tied, tennis does
things a little differently. Tie scores of 15-15 and 30-30 are called "15-all" and "30-all" respectively.
After this point, when the score is tied at 40-40 or beyond, the score is referred to as "Deuce". Once a
deuce situation is encountered, the score is called out according to which player has the "Advantage",
meaning the player that needs to win the next point to win the game. So, after a deuce the only two
possible scores would be "Advantage Player 1" or "Advantage Player 2". Depending on who wins
the point after that, either the game is over, or the score is tied at deuce again. The input text file will
contain an unknown number of lines. Each line will either contain a 1 or a 2, signifying which player won
the point. The program should print out the score of each game as it progresses. At the beginning of
each game, you should print the text "Game Start", and when a game is won you should print "Game
Player x", where x is the number of the player that won. The program should play as many games as
it can until the input runs out. Let the user input the file name from the keyboard. Refer to the sample
output below.
